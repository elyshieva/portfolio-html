<h1>About Me</h1>



<p> I'm Elyshieva, a passionate artist and developer known for merging the worlds of creativity and technology. Holding a master's degree in Informatics from the Technical University of Košice, Slovakia (2022), I've always been intrigued by the procedural generation within the realm of computer graphics. My master's thesis delved into this fascinating field, where I crafted a Java program capable of generating 3D polygonal river models based on user input. </p>
<p>Instead of relying on pre-existing game engines like Unity or jMonkey, my insatiable curiosity drove me to explore computer graphics at a deeper level. To do this, I embarked on the journey of creating a game engine from scratch using LWJGL, a Java library offering low-level access to the OpenGL API. Although my game engine project was ambitious, time constraints and the need for reliability for my thesis ultimately led me to employ a small licensed engine from one of the authors I had studied.</p>
<p>This project not only tested my coding prowess in object-oriented programming but also deepened my understanding of computer graphics principles and deepened my appreciation for them. </p>
<p>Beyond my academic pursuits, my artistic passions have flourished since before my university days and continue to thrive today. These creative skills have proven invaluable as I work on my latest project – a visually captivating narrative game with multiple endings developed in Unity.</p>
<p>My journey as an artist and developer is an ever-evolving adventure, marked by a relentless pursuit of innovation and the harmonious fusion of art and technology.</p>
